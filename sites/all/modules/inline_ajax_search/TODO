Still to Do
# Add translations
# Option to use Apache Solr when installed
# Option to use context search with Lucene
# Create comments in PHP and JavaScript
# Better javascript (no double scripts as it is now)
# Add views support (See http://drupal.org/node/773766)

Fixed:
# In the PHP use better t function, for better translatable strings
# Option to use the search also as a page in stead of only a block 
# Put the JavaScript variables in the Drupal.settings object in stead of his own inline script
# Place all the variables in the Drupal object (Drupal.inline_ajax_search). 
# Create tabs and default page for page settings, maybe even re-order the settings form
# On install or update set the Lucene API Search count to 150
# Dutch translation added
# Use a correct path to search for outside the admin path
# Minimize the JavaScript, not needed because of performance settins in drupal core
