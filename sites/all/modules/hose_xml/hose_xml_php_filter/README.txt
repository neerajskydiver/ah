Hose XML PHP Filter

This module provides a PHP filter for Hose XML profile elements where the output may be altered
using a PHP snippet.  The preferred method is to call a function in a custom module (usually 
specific to the project) which holds a library of custom output functions.

*** USAGE ***
Enable the module.
Edit a profile and enable the filter.
The filter textarea will appear in profile elements.
